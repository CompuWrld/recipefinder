I want to make a recipe app that queries a database of recipes. 

It would let the user submit and rate recipes, but then also let's you know what you need for the recipe and has a list of stocked items that you have, and what you can make and / or what you need to buy.

I want to add features like a scale up or down recipe feature to see how much of an item is needed.

I also want to add a feature that queries what you have in stock and what you can make with it.

Initially I plan on storing the data in JSON format, but later on I plan on utilizing a SQL based database.
